# Komboskini & Chotki vs. Rosary & Terço

The Roman Catholic Church uses the Terço and Rosary as prayer instruments, which involve the repetition of specific prayers while counting beads on a string of beads. In the Orthodox Church, there is a similar practice called the "Prayer Rope" or "Komboskini" (in Greek) and "Chotki" (in Russian). Below, I explain the Orthodox equivalents to the Catholic Terço and Rosary:

## Komboskini / Chotki (Prayer Rope)

**Description:** It is a string of beads, usually made of wool or other material, with a special knot or bead that serves as a point of reference.

**Usage:** Orthodox Christians use the rope to count repetitions of the "Jesus Prayer":
> *"Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me, a sinner."*
Each knot or bead represents one repetition of the prayer.

**Purpose:** It helps with concentration and meditation during prayer, aiding the faithful in maintaining spiritual focus and practicing incessant prayer.

## The Jesus Prayer

**Description:** It is the central prayer in Orthodox tradition, considered a form of continuous invocation of God's presence.

**Practice:** The "Jesus Prayer" is repeated incessantly while using the prayer rope, promoting a deeper union with God and the purification of the mind and heart.

## Differences and Similarities with the Catholic Rosary

### Structure

**Catholic Rosary:** Composed of 59 beads (including larger and smaller beads) and divided into mysteries that represent events from the life of Jesus and Mary. It involves the recitation of specific prayers like the Our Father, Hail Mary, and Glory Be.

**Komboskini / Chotki:** Typically composed of 33, 50, or 100 beads, without division into mysteries. It focuses on the continuous repetition of the "Jesus Prayer" without varying prayers as in the Rosary.

### Purpose

Both serve as tools to assist in the practice of continuous prayer and spiritual meditation. They promote discipline in prayer and help the faithful maintain a steady rhythm of devotion.

## Hesychast Spirituality

**Origin:** The practice of the prayer rope is deeply rooted in Hesychast spirituality, which emphasizes contemplative prayer and the pursuit of union with God through incessant prayer.

**Objective:** To achieve inner peace and the constant presence of God through the continuous repetition of the prayer.

## How to Use the Orthodox Prayer Rope

- Begin the Prayer: Start with the Lord's Prayer.
- Repetition of the Jesus Prayer: Use the rope to count repetitions of the "Jesus Prayer."
- Concentration and Meditation: Keep your mind focused on the prayer, allowing it to guide your meditation and spiritual reflection.

# Hesychasm

Hesychasm is a mystical and contemplative tradition within the Eastern Orthodox Church that emphasizes inner stillness, continuous prayer, and the pursuit of direct experience of God. Rooted in early Christian monasticism, Hesychasm seeks to cultivate a profound sense of inner peace and union with the divine through disciplined spiritual practices. Below is a comprehensive overview of Hesychasm, including its history, theological foundations, key practices, and guidance on how to begin practicing it.

## Overview of Hesychasm

Hesychasm derives from the Greek word "hesychia," meaning "stillness" or "quietude." It is a spiritual practice aimed at achieving inner tranquility and unceasing prayer, allowing practitioners to experience the presence of God directly. Hesychasm is deeply intertwined with the theology of the Eastern Orthodox Church, particularly the concepts of theosis (deification) and the essence-energies distinction introduced by St. Gregory Palamas.

## Historical Background

### Origins and Development

**Early Monasticism:** Hesychasm has its roots in the early monastic traditions of the Eastern Mediterranean, particularly in the desert monasteries where monks sought solitude and contemplative prayer.

**Byzantine Era:** The practice became more formalized during the Byzantine Empire, especially in the 14th century, through the teachings of St. Gregory Palamas. Palamas defended Hesychasm against theological criticisms, particularly those arising from the Hesychast Controversy, which debated the nature of the divine light experienced by practitioners.

### Hesychast Controversy

**Debate:** The controversy centered around whether Hesychasts could genuinely experience the uncreated divine light (often compared to the light seen by the Apostles during the Transfiguration) or if it was merely a psychological phenomenon.

**Palamas’ Defense:** St. Gregory Palamas articulated that the divine light experienced by Hesychasts was indeed the uncreated energies of God, distinct from His essence, allowing for a genuine experiential knowledge of God without compromising the transcendence of His essence.

## Theological Foundations

### Theosis (Deification)

**Definition:** Theosis is the process by which humans become partakers of the divine nature through grace, achieving a union with God.
**Goal of Hesychasm:** The ultimate aim of Hesychasm is theosis, achieved through disciplined prayer, purification of the heart, and unceasing communion with God.

### Essence-Energies Distinction

**Essence:** God's essence is utterly transcendent and unknowable.
**Energies:** God's energies are His actions and presence in the world, accessible to humans. Hesychasm focuses on experiencing these energies through prayer and contemplation.

## Key Practices of Hesychasm

### 1. The Jesus Prayer

**Formula:** "Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me, a sinner."
**Repetition:** The prayer is recited repeatedly, often in synchronization with the breath, to foster continual prayer and mindfulness of God’s presence.
**Purpose:** Helps in focusing the mind, calming the spirit, and fostering a direct relationship with Jesus Christ.

### 2. Inner Stillness and Silence

**Hesychia:** Cultivating inner stillness is essential for deep prayer and contemplation. This involves minimizing external distractions and calming the mind.
**Meditative Focus:** Practitioners aim to maintain a state of mental and emotional quietude, allowing the heart to open to divine grace.

### 3. Ascetic Discipline

**Self-Denial:** Practices such as fasting, celibacy, and simple living help purify the body and mind, making them more receptive to spiritual experiences.
**Routine:** Establishing a regular routine of prayer, work, and rest supports the cultivation of inner peace and discipline.

### 4. Posture and Breathing

**Posture:** Common postures include sitting or standing with a straight back, which aids in maintaining alertness and openness during prayer.
**Breathing:** Coordinating breath with the recitation of the Jesus Prayer helps in maintaining rhythm and focus.

### 5. Spiritual Guidance

**Spiritual Father:** Having a spiritual father or mentor is crucial. They provide guidance, support, and correction, helping practitioners navigate the spiritual path safely and effectively.
**Community:** Engaging with a monastic or lay community offers additional support and accountability.

## How to Practice Hesychasm

### 1. Learn the Jesus Prayer

**Start Simple:** Begin by learning the words and meaning of the Jesus Prayer.
**Repetition:** Integrate the prayer into your daily routine, repeating it several times a day to build familiarity and focus.

### 2. Create a Prayer Space

**Quiet Environment:** Designate a quiet place where you can pray without interruptions.
**Minimalist Setup:** Keep the space simple, perhaps with an icon or a cross to aid concentration.

### 3. Establish a Routine

**Regular Times:** Set specific times for prayer each day, such as morning, midday, and evening.
**Consistent Practice:** Consistency is key to developing the habit of unceasing prayer.

### 4. Practice Inner Stillness

**Mindfulness:** Focus on calming your thoughts and turning your attention inward.
**Breath Control:** Use deep, rhythmic breathing to help maintain focus and reduce mental chatter.

### 5. Engage in Ascetic Practices

**Self-Discipline:** Incorporate practices like fasting or simplifying your lifestyle to support your spiritual goals.
**Moderation:** Balance asceticism with your daily responsibilities to avoid burnout.

### 6. Seek Spiritual Guidance

**Find a Mentor:** Connect with a spiritual father or mentor who can guide you in your practice.
**Join a Community:** Participate in a monastic or lay community that practices Hesychasm for mutual support.

### 7. Reflect and Meditate

**Contemplative Reflection:** Spend time reflecting on the mysteries of faith, scripture, and the life of Christ.
**Divine Presence:** Aim to sense the presence of God in your heart and mind during prayer.

## Benefits of Practicing Hesychasm

**Deepened Spiritual Awareness:** Enhanced awareness of God’s presence and a more profound personal relationship with Him.
**Inner Peace:** Achieving mental and emotional tranquility through disciplined prayer and stillness.
**Emotional Stability:** Greater resilience and stability in facing life’s challenges.
**Spiritual Growth:** Progression towards theosis, or union with God, through continuous spiritual practices.
**Improved Focus and Concentration:** Enhanced ability to concentrate and maintain focus through repetitive prayer and mindfulness.

## Considerations and Cautions

**Proper Guidance:** Hesychasm is a profound and disciplined spiritual path that benefits greatly from the guidance of an experienced spiritual father to navigate its challenges and avoid potential pitfalls.
**Patience and Persistence:** Achieving inner stillness and deep communion with God requires time, patience, and persistent effort.
**Balance with Daily Life:** While monastic settings are ideal for Hesychasm, lay practitioners must find a balance between their spiritual practices and daily responsibilities.
**Avoiding Spiritual Pride:** Humility is essential. The goal is union with God, not personal achievement or pride.

# How to set up a traditional Orthodox prayer corner

We have often heard from customers, "How do I set up a prayer corner?" We are going to explain the idea of the home prayer corner, the meaning behind each element, and how to get started if you don't have one yet.

## Location

The Prayer Corner can be located in any convenient place in your home. The best place is a prominent wall or corner of your main living room, where the family can gather each day to pray. As Christians throughout history have traditionally prayed facing towards the East, an eastern wall or corner is ideal, if possible.

Instead (or in addition), a prayer corner may be located in a private space such as a bedroom, or even a closet. This is ideal for personal prayer and spiritual reading in a quiet environment, away from household distractions.

Some families will even dedicate an entire spare room to prayer, making it a home chapel. A few elaborate examples may be furnished as beautifully as an actual church! This is absolutely not necessary, but for those who have the means, it can be a special place to host prayer groups and weekday reader's services.

## Icons

The most fundamental element of the Prayer Corner is the Icon of Our Lord, God and Savior Jesus Christ. Icons help us give focus to our prayers, as we are able to direct our eyes to His face. Icons make spiritual realities present to us in a tangible way. In the theology of Orthodox iconography, the prayers and veneration directed to the Icons are passed on to the prototype—the person depicted in the image. For, as St. John of Damascus wrote: we do not worship paint or wood, we do not worship matter; we worship the God who created matter, who became matter (flesh) for our sake. To the icon of the Lord Jesus, we most often add the icon of His Mother, the Holy Virgin Mary. This is to honor her as the "highly favored one" (Lk. 1:28) who was chosen by God from all generations to give birth to God Incarnate: Jesus Christ. As the Queen Mother, she stands at his right hand (Ps. 44:8), so her icon is placed at the right (viewer's left) of the Christ icon. She is the holiest of saints, and her requests are heard by her Son (Jn. 2).

Legacy Icons offers a number of matching icon sets of Christ and the Virgin Mary (Theotokos, "God-bearer") that are sure to be stunning centerpieces to your home prayer corner, and museum quality heirlooms that will be passed on for generations. In addition to the icons of the Lord Jesus and the Virgin Mary, we will often add icons that have personal significance to us. In historic Christian tradition, we receive a Christian name at baptism. This is the name of a Saint, whom we will have a special relationship with for our entire life. The Church feast day of our name-saint becomes our own personal holiday called a Name Day (also called an Angel Day or Slava), much like a birthday, but more important as a spiritual day. We keep an icon of the Patron Saint to remind us of him or her, and make him or her present to our physical senses through the image that we can see. Each person also has a Guardian Angel who watches over our life, praying for us, prompting us to prayer and good works, protecting us from the demons, and caring for our soul immediately after death. As with our Patron Saint, our relationship with our Guardian Angel is important, and it is common to have his icon in our prayer corner. We may also develop close relationships with other Saints. Perhaps their lives inspire us in special ways, becoming role models we identify with in the ways they overcame the passions to follow Christ. We can keep these icons in our prayer corner as well, as they pray for us in God's heavenly kingdom.

Finally, we may want to keep icons from special events in the Church year, such as the Great Feasts, Lent, Pascha, or other events. These icons help keep us connected to the rhythms of the Church's life, and they are excellent teaching tools for young and old alike. And if you are interested in icons as teaching tools, don't miss our Legacy Learning Icon Cards, which are perfect for all ages!

## Candles & Lamps

From the earliest days, Light has been a part of Christian worship. This is not merely to give a beautiful and calming ambience; it took on a theological significance with Christ as the Light of the World. Christians used lamps and candles liturgically, as the Jews did before them. The ancient hymn Phos Hilarion ("O Gladsome Light") was sung at the hour of lamp-lighting, and it is still a prominent part of the Orthodox Vespers service today. You can bring this "Gladsome Light" into your own home prayer corner with beautiful oil lamps and candles from Legacy Icons. They serve the practical purpose of shedding a gentle light on your prayer corner and books as you pray, and they symbolize Christ as the Light. But in addition, the work of maintaining the lights in a prayerful way can become a sort of prayerful liturgy unto itself.

## Books

Home prayer is a highly personal matter of choice, discipline, and spiritual maturity and strength. In Church we join ourselves to the work of a common prayer (a liturgy), but at home we find a personal expression of our faith within the Church's guidance. We offer a selection of books specially curated for home prayer that we think will appeal to Christians at all stages of their growth.

## Devotional Items

The rich spirituality of Orthodox Christianity includes a variety of spiritual aids and reminders that may find a place in your home prayer corner. The most well-known of these is the Prayer Rope.
